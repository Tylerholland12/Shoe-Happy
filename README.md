# Shoe-Happy
"""
This website is dedigned for the purpose of finding the right shoe for the user but at the end the user is subject to always getting the 
same shoe over and over again if they were to pick the same category over and over again.
This is because the website is only keying in to what the user actually wants rather than giving the user a list of random shoe that cannot
prove to be the right fit for them.
The end shoe at the end of each quiz only picks the shoe that matches the category and not that of the questions.
There is also a cool grid that the user is able to play around with if they can find where it is hidden!!!
